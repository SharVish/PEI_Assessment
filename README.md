# PEI_Assessment
This repo contains the assessment documents and findings for PEI Sales demo data

The data analysis is split into three sections:

1. Data Exploration and Findings - EDA (ipynb - Jupyter Notebook) - showing the EDA steps, findings, and the requirements for the anticipated datasets. The EDA was done using Python and the scripts were run on a Jupyter notebook. Appropriate comments have been added to explain the thought flow wherever applicable.

2. Data Modelling - Report (pdf file) - showing the assumptions made, ERD diagram/schema, data flow diagram, data definitions, data mapping, and areas of concern. This report is meant to be representative only.

3. PEI_Assessment - Power BI Document (pbix file) - the Power BI document has two pages: Sales Overview and Order Details. The graphs and visualizations aim to answer the questions posed in the requirements from the Sales team. A drill-through feature is provided on 3 visuals and they are indicated by an "info (i)" button next to the title of the visuals wherever applicable. A "back" button is made available on the second page (Order Details) for easy navigation.
