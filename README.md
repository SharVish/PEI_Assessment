# PEI_Assessment
This repo contains the assessment documents and findings for PEI Sales demo data

The data analysis is split into two sections:

1. Data Exploration and Findings - EDA (HTML file) - showing the EDA steps, findings, and the requirements for the anticipated datasets. The EDA was done using Python and the scripts were run on a Jupyter notebook. Appropriate comments have been added to explain the thought flow wherever applicable.

2. Data Modelling - Report (pdf file) - showing the assumptions made, ERD diagram/schema, data flow diagram, data definitions, data mapping, and areas of concern. This report is meant to be representative only.

I understand that there is no need to visualize the final report since the focus is on getting the correct understanding of the datasets, checking their completeness, reliability, and accuracy, outlining the requirements for the anticipated datasets, and finally coming up with the appropriate data model. If there is a need to visualize the report with as-is data, I will be happy to provide a report/dashboard or the answers to the report questions. I already have the data loaded in Power BI as part of the visual EDA in combination with programmatic EDA.
